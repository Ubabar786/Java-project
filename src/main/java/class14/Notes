Access Modifiers:
- Access modifiers are keywords in java help us control
  the access of Instance and Static variables and they can
  also be used to control the access of methods and classes.
- There are four access levels:
1) Private - Individual use only in that class
2) Protected - You and Family
3) Default
4) Public
- There are three keywords in java to apply these access levels:
1) instance
2) static
3) local

Best Practices:
- Instance variables/fields/properties/attributes are
private 99% of the time.
- 99% of the times constructors are public
- 90% of the times methods are public
- 8% are private and rest of the time are default or protected
