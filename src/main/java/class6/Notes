Operators:
Operators are symbol which perform an operation on data.
There are many different types of operators in Java.
1) Arithmetic Op;
These operators help us perform simple mathematical op like;
Addition   => +   int a=10, int b=20, int c=a+b   =>30
Subtraction   => -
Multiplication   => *
Division   => /
Modulus   => %

2) Shorthand Op;
They are help us perform mathematical operators but using a little shorter syntax.
Add and update the variable   +=  //int a=10, a+=20  => 30.
Subtract and update the variable   => int a=10, a-=20   =>10
Multiply and update the variable   *= int a=10, a*=20   =>200
Divide and update the variable   /= int a=10, a/=20   => 0
Modulus and update the variable   %= int a=10, a%=20   =>10

3) Relational Op;
There operators help us compare things.
== checks if two objects are equal
!= checks is two objects are Not equal
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than equal
<= less than equal

4) Logical Operators
There help us combine multiple boolean conditions
! Not
|| OR
&& AND
Increment/Decrement Operators;
++ this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
-- this will help us decrease the value of a variable by one.

Note:
While loop checks the condition first and then executes the code.
Do While loop executes the code first and then checks the condition.
Sometimes when we write the logic using do while it becomes easier.
There are no other differences and reasons to use a do while instead of while.
