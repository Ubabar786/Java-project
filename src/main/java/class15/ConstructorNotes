Constructors:
- Constructor help us build objects from classes easily.
- They help us give initial values to the instance fields.
- The name of the constructor must be the same as the class name.
- Constructors don't have any return types.
- Most of the times constructors are public.
- Other than initialising the values we can have whatever
  type of code inside the constructor that we like
  e.g. calling methods writing if-else etc.

Syntax:
Class ClassName{
String name;

public ClassName{
