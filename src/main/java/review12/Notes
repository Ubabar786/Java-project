Set:
- Sets are special set of classes which do not allow duplicate elements.
  Set is the main interface and there are three main classes which
  implement this interface.
1) HashSet
2) LinkedHashSet
3) TreeSet

- HashSet:
Upside - removes duplicates and its the fastest
Downside - does not maintain insertion order

- LinkedHashSet:
Upside - Maintains the insertion order
Downside - Its a little slower than HashSet

TreeSet:
Upside - Keeps the data in sorted form and searching through large amount of elements is very fast
Downside - Insertion is very very slow
