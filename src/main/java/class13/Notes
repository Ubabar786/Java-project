Types of variables:
- There are three types of variables;
local - temporary duration of time

instance- Long duration of time

static- permanently duration of time

1) Local - are the variables which create/declare inside
a block of code e.g. if else condition, loops, switch, methods.
Upside:
- They occupy the memory for shortest period of time.
As soon as Java is done executing that block of code,
they are removed from the memory.
Downside:
- They can only be accessed within the block of code,
they are created.

2) Instance - are the variables which are created outside
the block of codes e.g. if else, switch,
loops or methods but inside the class.
Upside:
- They can be accessed anywhere within that class.
Downside:
- They are created when an object of the class is created and
they will stay in the memory as long as that object is in the
memory whether you use them or not.

Local vs Instance:
- Whenever it is possible go and create local variables.
- Only go with Instance variable, if you can't solve
a problem with the local variable.

3) Static - are created inside a class but outside of a block
of code with a static keyword. This can't be local.
Upside:
- They are universal when it come to scope and accessibility.
- We don't even need to create the object of that class in which they are created
we can simply write the name of the class and we can access it.
Downside:
- Static variables occupy memory space for the longest period of time.
- They are created even though you don't create any object of
the class.

Uses of types of local variables:
Local - When we ae solving any problem, many times we need local variables
to temporarily store data. In all of those cases you should be going with local
variables.

Notes:
We will do a little bit of StringBuilder
We will discuss Thread safety,
StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
