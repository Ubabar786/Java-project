Enhanced For Loop:
- Enhance For Loop is used to iterate through datastructures
which have multiple items stored inside them.
- Why should we use Enhanced For Loops:
   It's simple and easy to understand.
- Syntax:
   for"DataTypesOfElement anyVariableName:NameOfTheDataStructure){

}

Limitations of Enhanced For Loop:
  1) Enhanced For Loop can't be used for updating the elements.
  2) Access the elements in reverse order etc.

Break Keyword:
- Break keyword is used in switch case statements and with the loops
to terminate the loops prematurely.
- Why we should use it?
It can save the machine from running unnecessarily.

Continue Keyword:
- Continue keyword is used to skip the code from a loop
once we hit the skip keyword java ignores the rest of the code
in the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
