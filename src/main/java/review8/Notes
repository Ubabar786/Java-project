Interview Q's:
Q: Can we have a private constructor?
A: Yes
Q: Can we use Static with a constructor?
A: No
Q: Can i use return keyword in a constructor?
A: Yes

Why should we use Constructors?
- Cleaner code, secure code by making it private

"This" keyword:
- We can access the instance variables with 'this' keyword
  when there is a local variable in the same scope.
- We can call one constructor inside another one in the same class
  if we want to have the code from the other class.
