Super Keyword:
- Super keyword is used to access things from the parent class.
- We can access instance variables, Methods and Constructors.

Why should we learn about Super:
1) Without Super() we can't call the constructor from the parent
   class and we might need to repeat that constructor in all classes
   and if someone declares the fields private, we can't access the
   fields in child classes.
2) We can use super() to call the fields from the parent class,
   even if we have same name fields in the child class.

Rules:
1) When we use super() we must class at least one constructor from
   the parent class. Java needs at least one constructor from parent.
   As it always first creates the object of the parent class when we
   create the object of the child class.
2) When we have same name field as local instance and in the parent
   class as well.. Java prefers the local first, then instance from same
   class and lastly Parent class. However, if we directly want to access
   the field from the parent class, we can use super() keyword.
