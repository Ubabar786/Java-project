Method Overloading:
-  Method Overloading happens when multiple methods with same name
   but with different parameters.
- Signature method = name of the methods and the parameters are called Signature.
- Header of a method includes signature plus return type plus access modifier
1) Different numbers of parameters e.g. min(2,3) min(4,5,6)
2) Different dataType of methods e.g. print("Java"), print(12);
3) Different sequence/order of parameters
   e.g. print("Java", 12), print(12, "Java")

Why should we learn about method overloading:
1) Cleaner code
2) We don't need to create different method names

Syntax:

class Calculator{

int add(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}

double add(double a, double b, double c){
return a+b+c;
}
}

Method Overriding:
- Method Overriding happens when same name method is
  present in parent as well as child class.
