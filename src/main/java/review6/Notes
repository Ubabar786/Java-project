What is Object oriented programming? (OOP)
- It's simply a way of writing code,
   some rules that we follow.
There are other ways as well like functional programming, procedural programming.
There are four main pillars of object oriented programming(OOP):
1) Inheritance
2) Polymorphism(many forms)
3) Abstraction(partial code)
4) Encapsulation

Why should we learn OOP:
1) Code re-usability
2) Easier to write large amounts of code
3) Sharing code with others become easier.
4) Security of the code is increased.
5) Changing code becomes easier.

Object:
An Object is something that we can physically touch.
Everything around us like chairs, tables, computer etc.
They are all objects. We can easily represent these
objects inside our computers, by telling a computer
how it looks and how it behaves.

Class:
A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String class:
A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data.
Most of the information inside computers is processed in this form.
String is most widely used class in all java.
