Type Casting:
Converting data from one data type to another data type
For e.g. boolean to string or integer to float.
Type casting only works with primitive data types
There are two types of type casting;
1) Implicit/Auto/Widening type casting
2) Explicit/Manual/Narrowing

Example;
int number=(float)10.5 - this is an error,
it should match the parenthesis,
instead of float it should be (int).

int number=(int)10.5 - is a correct type cast
float number2=567.87;
double number3=(number2);
System.out.println(number3);
===========================================================
if statements
They are part of the conditional constructs in java.
They help us write code that can be executed based on a condition.
There are many variations of if statements;
1) if
2) if-else
3) else-if
4) Nested if
Why we need conditional statements?
Without the if statements programs will always generate same output no matter what.

Syntax;
if(Condition)   {
something that we want to execute if condition is true
}else{
something that we want to execute if something is false
}

Note:
1)Whenever it is possible to write code with else-if and multiple if conditions
Always go with else-if statements.
2) With primitive data types we can use > < == != etc
3) Non primitive we have use the (.equals) method
