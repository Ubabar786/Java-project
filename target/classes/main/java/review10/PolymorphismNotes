Polymorphism:
- It's the ability of an object to behave differently.
- We can achieve polymorphism in two ways;
  method overloading and method overriding(Very common)

Why should we learn about Polymorphism?
1) It allows us to write dynamic programs, which can save us
   lots of code repetition.

Example:
- WebDriver driver=new Chromedriver();

Interview Questions:
- Do we need Method Overriding for Polymorphism?
Yes but we can also use Method Overloading.

Abstraction:
- Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details
  and showing only the functionality.
- We can achieve using abstract classes and interfaces.

Why?
- When we use Abstraction it can simplify our codes.
  Those classes which don't need to provide an implementation
  to the methods can leave it.

Keyword:
- abstract.

Interview Q's:
Can we have private methods as abstract methods?
- Private means no participation in inheritance which results
  to no overriding which will make abstract method useless.
Can we have a method as final and abstract at the same time?
- Final means something is complete and can't be modified and
abstract means something is incomplete and requires modification.
These are opposite to each other and not allowed.

Interfaces:
- Interfaces are a collection public static final variables and
  methods which are by default public and abstract. After Java 8
  we can have default, static and private methods as well.

Why use interfaces?
1) There is no Diamond problem in interfaces which allow us to have
   multiple inheritances.
2) They are light weight, simple contracts and can be used even if the
   classes are not related to each other.

Interview Q's:
Can we have private variables in an interface?
- No
Can we have private methods as abstract methods?
- Private means no participation in inheritance which results
  to no overriding which will make abstract method useless.
Can we have a method as final and abstract at the same time?
- Final means something is complete and can't be modified and
abstract means something is incomplete and requires modification.
These are opposite to each other and not allowed.
