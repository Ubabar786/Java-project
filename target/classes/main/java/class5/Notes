Logical Operators:
Logical Operators help combine multiple conditions on the same line if statements.
There are three types of Logical Operators;
1) NOT (!)
2) OR (||)
3) AND (&&)

NOT(!):
true=>false
false=>true
Why should we use NOT operator:
1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
2) Code readability will increase

OR(||):
Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions in such a way
that as soon as one condition gets true the whole condition will be
evaluated to true.
true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false
false||true||true=.true

AND(&&):
Logical and operator will help us combine the conditions in such a way
that it will only give us true if all the conditions are true.
true && false && true=>false
true && true && true=>true
true && true && false=>false
