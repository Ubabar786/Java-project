Maps:
- Maps are dataStructures which stores key value pairs.
- Maps are collections of entries and entries are collections of key value pairs.
- There are many different types of maps in java we will be discussing;
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap
4) HashTable
- Maps is the name of the interface and HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap and HashTable
  are the classes that implements this interface.

Why we should learn about Maps?
- All the other dataStructures that we have learnt can only store one value
  at a time and they are indexed based.
- Maps allow us to store key values pairs which makes it a better choice
  because we know what we are storing.

Syntax:
NameOfTheClass<DataType, DataTypeOfValue> variableName=new NameOfTheCLass<>();
ArrayList<String> names=new ArrayList<>();
