File?
File is something that we use to store information.
E.g.:
1) txt files are use to store raw text
2) pdf files are usually used to store books and articles
3) xlsx files are usually used to store info in the form of a table
4) .jpg .jpeg .png files are used to store images
5) /mp4 .mkv .mov are used to store videos.

Why we use files?
- It's easier to move the info around because its just one single file.

Folders/Directories:
- Its like a container for files. It can contain many different files.
  We can use it to organise the info.

File Handling:
- File handling is creating/editing/accessing/deleting the files on a computer
  with the help of a programming language.

Steps to work with file:
1) To locate the file usually we use the absolute paths for that
   for example "C/Users/Syntax/Desktop/Batch17/names.txt"
2) We need to have access and a piece of software that can edit/open that file.
3) To bring files from permanent storage into the RAM.

What is RAM?
- Temporary storage its very fast but very expensive and does not store data
  permanently. Once we turn off the computer everything that we put in the RAM
  is gone.

What is HDD/SSD/NVME/Storage?
- Its the permanent storage that we use to store things its cheap but slow.

Why should we learn about File Handling?
- So that we can store the data permanently
- We can store the sensitive data like userNames passWords etc inside the files
  and keep them secure on our computers and don't push it with code on github.
- All the configuration related information like URLs and types of testing will
also be stored in the files.
