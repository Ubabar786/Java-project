Nested Loops:
- A Nested Loop is a loop inside another loop which allows
us to find data within the loop.
It is used to solve complex problems in which we have nested data
or we need to perform nested iterations.
We can nest a for loop inside a while loop or a for loop
inside another for loop.

Why we need Nested Loops:
- A tester will be needing them to read excel data.
we will be needing them to go through multiple pages
from each page we might want to go through multiple items.

Syntax:
- for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
   for (int j=0; j<10; j++){
   }
 }

Arrays:
 - Arrays help us store multiple objects of the same type of data
 in just one variable.
 They are indexed based datastructures. Every item that we store
 inside an Array is assigned a number, that number is called index.
 Whenever we want to get qny value from the array,  we provide that index.

 Why we need Arrays:
 - We can use multiple variables as well to store multiple items but
 when the data is large, it's almost impossible to handle the variables.
 Imagine we have to store the names of all the people living in a city.

 Syntax:
 - There are two ways of creating an Array;
1) DataType [] nameOfArray={element1,element2,element3};
    int [] ages={35,22,29,45};

2) DataType [] nameOfArray= new DataType[Quantity];
    int [] ages= new int[5];
    ages[0]=43;
    ages[1]=15;
    ages[2]=34;
    ages[3]=96;
    ages[4]=78;
    ages[5]=65;
