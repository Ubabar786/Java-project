Super Keyword:
- Super keyword refers to parent class. We can use super keyword to access
variables, methods and constructors from the parent class.

Why we should use super keyword?
1) To specifically call something form the parent class, like a variable or method.
2) We can use super() to call the constructor from the parent class.

Method Overloading:
1) When we have same method with different parameters, its called method overloading.
2) Parameters can be different in 3 ways;
- We can change the count of parameters. We can overload methods as well as constructors.
- We can change the dataType of parameters if number of parameters are the same.
- We can change the sequence if dataType and number of parameters are the same.

Why?
1) Cleaner code: we don't have to come up with different method names.
2) reuse: same name can be reused many times.
